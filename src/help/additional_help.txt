Param should be in the format key=value, where key is the
name of the binding and value is the contents of the
binding. If you wish to pull the contents of a binding
from a file, you may do so by inserting an `@` symbol at
the beginning of the contents and specifying a path. Full
paths or relative paths from the current working directory
are accepted.

Ex:  `-p my_cert=@path/to/my_cert.pem`

By default bindings will be generated under `./bindings`,
however you may set `SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT` to change this
location.

All types and param key names must be valid file names.
